# Domain Adaptation for Multi-lingual POS tagging
This is a repository that contains the code for our project for DSGA-1012 Natural Language Understanding


This project works on implimenting a multi lingual POS tagging algorithm  for multiple domains. 

We have uploaded the data_generation.ipynb file that merges the different languags dataset and performs the universal tags mapping. 

The data_clean.ipynb is use to remve anly dataype values other than strings from the dataset.
